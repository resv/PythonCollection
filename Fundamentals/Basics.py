#PRINT STATEMENT
print('hello')

#PRINT ASSIGNMENT
x = 6
print(x)

#PRINT W/ VARIABLE CONDITION
x = 43
x = x + 1
print(x)

#IF STATEMENT / CONDITIONAL STEPS
#indentation aka 4 spaces is important. Colons are necessary
#prints smaller then finis, "bigger" is skipped due to the 1st if being statisfied
x = 5
if x < 10:
    print('Smaller')
if x > 20:
    print('Bigger')
print('Finis')

#WHILE LOOPS
#condition is true in a loop so it will print until we lower N to 0
n = 5
while n > 0 :
    print (n)
    n = n - 1
print('Blastoff!')

#CONSTANTS
#string constants use single ' or double "

#Reserved words are special words that python are listening for them.
#Reserved words: False, None, True, and, as, assert, break, class, if, def, del, elif,
#Reserved words cont: else, except, return, for, from, global, try, import, in, is, lambda
#Reserved words cont: while, not, or, pass, raise, finally, continue, nonlocal, with, yield

#NAMING CONVENTION
#Py must start with a letter or underscore_ and case sensitive

#MNEMONIC = MEMORY AID
#Choosing a variable name that helps us remember what we intend to store.

#KEYWORDS
#Values: True, False, None
#Conditions: if, elif, else
#Logical operators: and, or, not
#Loops: for, in, while, break, continue
#Functions: def, return  

#Arithmetic operators
# x + y            Addition + operator returns the sum of x plus y
# x - y             Subtraction - operator returns the difference of x minus y
# x * y            Multiplication * operator returns the product of x times y
# x / y             Division / operator returns the quotient of x divided by y
# x**e            Exponent ** operator returns the result of raising x to the power of e 
# x**2            Square expression returns x squared
# x**3            Cube expression returns x cubed
# x**(1/2)    Square root (Â½) or (0.5) fractional exponent operator returns the square root of x
# x // y           Floor division operator returns the integer part of the integer division of x by y
# x % y          Modulo operator returns the remainder part of the integer division of x by y


#Order of operations
#The order of operations are to be calculated from left to right in the following order
#Parentheses ( ), { }, [ ]
#Exponents xe   (x**e)
#Multiplication * and Division /  
#Addition + and Subtraction -    
#You might find the PEMDAS mnemonic device to be helpful in remembering the order.   

#find out data type 
# print(type("a"))
   #<class 'str'>
# print(type("2"))
   #<class 'int'>
# print(type(2.5))
   #<class 'float'>
