#PRINT STATEMENT
print('hello')

#PRINT ASSIGNMENT
x = 6
print(x)

#PRINT W/ VARIABLE CONDITION
x = 43
x = x + 1
print(x)

#IF STATEMENT / CONDITIONAL STEPS
#indentation aka 4 spaces is important. Colons are necessary
#prints smaller then finis, "bigger" is skipped due to the 1st if being statisfied
x = 5
if x < 10:
    print('Smaller')
if x > 20:
    print('Bigger')
print('Finis')

#WHILE LOOPS
#condition is true in a loop so it will print until we lower N to 0
n = 5
while n > 0 :
    print (n)
    n = n - 1
print('Blastoff!')

#CONSTANTS
#string constants use single ' or double "
